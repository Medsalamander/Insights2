    "Data Wrangling process involves 3 specific steps and these include \n",

    "- Gathering\n",
    "- Assessing\n",
    "- Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "The gathering process started with importing the following libraries\n",
    "- import pandas as pd\n",
    "- import numpy as np\n",
    "- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "- %matplotlib inline\n",
    "- import requests\n",
    "- import tweepy\n",
    "- from tweepy import OAuthHandler\n",
    "- import re\n",
    "- import os\n",
    "- import json\n",
    "- from timeit import default_timer as timer\n",
    "- import datetime as dt\n",
    "- import seaborn as sns\n",
    "- from textblob import TextBlob\n",
    "- rom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "The data gathering process commenced with reading the provided twitter-archive-enhanced.csv file with the Pandas.read_csv method. The resulting file was saved using the variable name twitter_archive. \n",
    "Also, the provided url was used to download the images programmatically and the resulting tab separated file was saved as image-predictions.tsv. The resulting file was then saved to the variable image_prediction.\n",
    "The final data importation process involved querying the twitter API for additional information regarding already provided tweet ids. The resulting list from the query was saved to a Pandas Dataframe and then read using the Pandas.read_csv method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Assessment \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Assessment\n",
    "The 3 dataframe were first assessed visually using the df.sample method. Few obvious data quality issues were identified, and these include\n",
    "- Missing values in most columns of the twitter_archive dataframe\n",
    "- Unusual characters in the name column of twitter_archive dataframe\n",
    "- Number of rows in all 3 dataframe did not match\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programmatic Assessment\n",
    "The following functions were used to quickly assess all 3 dataframe\n",
    "- Pd.head()\n",
    "- Pd.info()\n",
    "- Pd.describe()\n",
    "- Pd.isnull().sum()\n",
    "- Pd.[tweet_id).duplicated().sum()\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual and programmatic assessment yielded the following data quality and tidiness issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quality Issues \n",
    "- twitter_archive['name'] has some unusual lower-cased names\n",
    "- twitter_archive['Timestamp'] data type is listed as an object instead of datetime, split into 2 columns(date, time)\n",
    "- Source is a hyperlink\n",
    "- tweet_id for all 3 tables is listed as int datatype\n",
    "- Analysis requires actual tweets and not retweets. Rows that are retweets will be dropped   \n",
    "retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_timestamp and retweeted_status_user_id are not needed for the analysis and therefore will be dropped.\n",
    "- in_reply_to_status_id and in_reply_to_user_id are listed as floats\n",
    "- p1, p2, p3 columns in image_prediction contains unusual character(_)\n",
    "- Inconsistent casing in p1, p2, p3\n",
    "- total rating column missing\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tidiness Issues\n",
    "- doggo, floofer, puppo and pupper columns need not be in separate columns\n",
    "- twitter_archive_1 contains columns that required for analysis and therefore will be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning process is done in three steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define\n",
    "- Code\n",
    "- Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the issues listed above, a problem statement is defined for each data quality and tidiness issue. This is followed with the appropriate code structured to resolve the defined issue.Finally, testing to confirm issue resolution.\n",
